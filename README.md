Analyzing how international tariffs impact the U.S. trade balance using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Regression Analysis
# Tariff Impact Analysis: U.S. Trade Balance

This project analyzes how different countries' tariffs affect the U.S. trade balance in 2024.  
Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we explored correlations between tariff rates and trade deficits.

## Key Features
- ðŸ“Š Data cleaning and preparation
- ðŸ”¥ Correlation analysis
- ðŸ“ˆ Regression analysis with prediction line
- ðŸŒŽ Trade deficits and surplus visualizations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

## Key Insights
## Key Insights

- ðŸ“‰ The correlation between tariff rates and U.S. trade deficits was weak to moderate, suggesting tariffs are not the sole driver of trade balances.
- ðŸ“ˆ The regression analysis revealed that higher tariffs did not consistently lead to a reduction in the trade deficit. In fact, some countries with higher tariffs still maintained significant trade deficits with the U.S.
- ðŸŒŽ Population size showed a positive correlation with trade volume but did not directly correlate with an improved trade balance.
- ðŸ”Ž The results indicate that factors beyond tariffs â€” such as economic structure, consumer demand, and supply chain dependencies â€” play a major role in determining trade outcomes.
